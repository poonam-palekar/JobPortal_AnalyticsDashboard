# JobPortal_AnalyticsDashboard
Built an interactive Job Analytics Dashboard during my internship at NullClass. Cleaned and transformed job data using Python (Pandas), and developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to uncover market trends.

This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and 
visualizing job-related data to uncover valuable
 insights. By leveraging modern data science and 
visualization tools, we aim to enhance the decision-making process in the job sector.

Tools & Technologies Used
To achieve this, we utilized:
Data Cleaning: Used Python (Pandas) to preprocess, clean, and transform job data for analysis.
Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau for better data representation.
Web Hosting: Hosted the visualized insights on a website using Netlify to ensure accessibility and usability.
